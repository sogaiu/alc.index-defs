# Use Cases

* Want to easily navigate source without firing up a REPL?  For example, just downloaded a project and don't have it running?  Or may be sometimes you don't want to have to start a REPL just to examine some code paths?  [1]

* The editor setup you're using doesn't support jumping to definitions within dependencies?

* The editor setup you're using can't account for the namespace portion of identifiers?

* The editor setup you're using doesn't handle enough of the identifiers in your code base, possibly because it doesn't know how to appropriately determine identifiers?

[1] Note that the tool that's typically used to resolve / fetch dependencies for the project is still needed.
